# LFSR Encryption algorithm

The basic idea of streaming cryptosystems is to encrypt the source text M using a cryptographic key K, whose length is equal to the length of the text. Each ciphertext bit Ci is a function of the corresponding bits of the source text. and key stream.

The symbol âŠ• denotes the addition operation "EXCLUSIVE-OR". Due to the linear properties of this operation when encrypting and decrypting the same key stream K is used. Obviously, in this case the length K must be equal to the length of the transmitted message. However, key exchange large size is often impossible. Therefore, in practice, to form keystream use pseudo-random sequence generators
